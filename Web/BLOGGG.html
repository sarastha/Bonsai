    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p><b> The impact of technology on selling Bonsai plants is both positive and negative.</b></p>
    </div>
    <p> The technology has improved marketing tactics, made purchasing Bonsai easier and more comfortable, 
        and increased the reach of bonsai farmers. </p>
    <p> However, it has made shipping and security more difficult. It has also increased competition. 
        The use of technology in the sale of bonsai plants will ultimately depend on the individual 
        grower and their business objectives.</p>
